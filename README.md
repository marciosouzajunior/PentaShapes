# 🎸 PentaShapes
[https://pentashapes.web.app](https://pentashapes.web.app)  

**PentaShapes** is an interactive web tool that helps guitarists visualize and understand scales across the fretboard.

You choose the root note, scale type (like pentatonic), and which shapes to display — and the app shows the intervals on the neck, making it easier to connect patterns and create solos.

## 💭 Why this project?

Many guitar players know scale shapes — but struggle to use them musically. **PentaShapes** was created to bridge that gap, by showing intervals clearly and helping players think beyond shapes.
